# PaperTrail — map your evidence, follow the story.

PaperTrail is a lightweight visual evidence board for organizing ideas, documents, images, and links. It lets you pin down pieces of information, connect them freely, and uncover patterns. Whether you’re researching, investigating, or just making sense of complex projects, PaperTrail helps you create a clear trail of evidence you can return to and share.
